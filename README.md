# Deep Transfer Learning on PyTorch
This is a PyTorch library for deep transfer learning. And this is a part of another repository---[transferlearning](https://github.com/jindongwang/transferlearning) which I will merge this into. If you need more code, please refer to [code](https://github.com/jindongwang/transferlearning/tree/master/code/deep). Here I have implemented some deep transfer methods as follows:
* DDC：Deep Domain Confusion Maximizing for Domain Invariance
* DAN: Learning Transferable Features with Deep Adaptation Networks
* Deep Coral: Deep CORAL Correlation Alignment for Deep Domain Adaptation
* Revgrad: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation with Adversarial Residual Transform Networks

> Note that the results without **this** comes from [paper](http://ise.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/~mlong/doc/multi-adversarial-domain-adaptation-aaai18.pdf). The results with **this** are run by myself with the code.
